# AngularList

This Project is a take home assignment for PGI

## Features

Requires: Angular 7+, TypeScript, some form of unit testing, Material Angular Design Library implemented. Allows the user to Create to dos, edit to dos, mark to dos complete, and delete to dos. 10 hours of work.

## Approach

I started out researching Angular tutorials and seeing slightly different instructions (W3 Schools, Angular.io, Angular PhoneCat Tutorial) and ultimately proceeded with an App created through Angular CLI and studied its structural differences compared to the other resources I had examined (listed above). Then I created two main components, a header and a list, and set up data binding for each component. After this I moved onto implementing Material Angular. I spent a fair amount of time exploring dead ends in Material Angular (such as adding buttons to mat-list vs mat-card) for the overall UI design. If I had more time I would have stayed the course on these different approaches, but I was focused on getting the highest % complete in the alloted time. This experience with Angular Material reminded me of my first time using React-Bootstrap. It just took me a little time to learn the small nuance differences with React-Bootstrap for layout and component styling from what I was familiar with. As time wore down I fell back on adding some basic CSS.

## Challenges and Areas for Future Improvement

I would really like to improve the unit testing for this project, seperate concerns in the List component (should be broken down into smaller component pieces), clean up package imports, do a full review of code formatting (I was reviewing for bad indendation and spacing when I ran out of time), and seperate the data into a JSON file. I had started out with goal of approaching this with test driven development, but felt like it was overall holding back getting the full functionality complete in the allotted time. This was a really wonderful learning experience for me. I went down several rabbit holes of different approaches to structuring my application in Angular. While this reduced the time I could give to unit testing, it was a wonderful learning experience for me. I going to fully complete every tutorial I looked at for this to understand the small differences I was seeing moving forward.
